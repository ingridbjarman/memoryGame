# Game of Memory using The Cat API

<img src="img/cat.gif" alt="Demo"/>

This is a **Game of Memory** (*or pairs, or concentration, whatever you'd like to call it...*) that uses [The Cat API](https://thecatapi.com/) to generate the cats you need to pair up. 

To play, simply clone this repository to your local machine, and open the index.html file in your broswer. Good luck!
